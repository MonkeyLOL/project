// The SceneObject class is the parent of all objects in the scene graph.
// To make an object to use in the scene graph, inherit this class and
// override the methods private_init, private_update and private_render.
//
// The rest of the magic creating the scene graph is implemented in the
// methods init, update and render. Do NOT override those methods.
//
// The application is to create a "root" instance of SceneObject (or another
// class inheriting SceneObject). Then:
//  Call the root.init after OpenGL is initialized,
//  call root.update in the render-function, and
//  call root.render after update has been called.
//
// private_init: Here all the initializer-code is put, this method is called
//      after OpenGL has been initialized.
// private_update: This method is called prior to any rendering, animation-
//      code is to be implemented in here (motion, collition-detection). When
//      this method is called, the member sslf_ has been set, so time-dependent
//      animation can use this value.
// private_render: This is where the rendering-code is implemented. Here you
//      do all the actual drawing.
//
// matrix_: This is the transformation matrix of the scene-object. This
//      transformation is relative to the object's parent. The transformation
//      is performed as part of the scene graph-magic.
//
// The storage of the children is handled by smart pointers, this is because
